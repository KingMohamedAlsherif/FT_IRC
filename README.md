# FT_IRC
Build an IRC server (`ircserv`) in C++ 98 that handles multiple clients using non-blocking I/O with `poll()`. Supports TCP/IP, authentication, nicknames, channels, private messages, and operator commands (`KICK`, `INVITE`, `TOPIC`, `MODE`). Takes port and password, works with an IRC client, and includes a Makefile. No external libs.
